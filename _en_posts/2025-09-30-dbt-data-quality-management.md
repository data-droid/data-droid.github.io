# Complete Guide to Data Quality Management with dbt - Core of Modern Data Pipelines

> They say **"data is the new oil"**, but unrefined oil is useless. dbt is the core tool of that **data refinery**.

In the modern data stack, dbt goes beyond being a simple transformation tool to serve as the **guardian of data quality**. This post covers how to build a complete data quality management system using dbt and major data platforms.

|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **SQL-Centric** | Data transformation using SQL instead of Python/R | Easy for analysts to use |
| **Version Control** | Code management integrated with Git | Easy collaboration and change tracking |
| **Automated Testing** | Built-in data quality tests | Quality assurance and reliability |
| **Documentation** | Auto-generated data documentation | Improved team communication |
| **Modularity** | Reusable macros | Enhanced development efficiency |

### dbt's Role in Modern Data Stack

## 🧪 Data Quality Testing Framework {#data-quality-testing-framework}

### Generic Tests

#### 1. **not_null**: NULL value validation
```yaml
# models/schema.yml
models:
  - name: users
    columns:
      - name: user_id
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: email
        tests:
          - not_null
```

#### 2. **unique**: Duplicate value validation
```yaml
models:
  - name: users
    columns:
      - name: user_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
```

#### 3. **accepted_values**: Allowed value validation
```yaml
models:
  - name: orders
    columns:
      - name: status
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ['pending', 'completed', 'cancelled']
```

#### 4. **relationships**: Referential integrity validation
```yaml
models:
  - name: orders
    columns:
      - name: user_id
        tests:
          - relationships:
              to: ref('users')
              field: user_id
```

### Custom Tests

#### 1. **Single test file**
```sql
-- tests/assert_positive_amount.sql
select *
from ref('orders')
where amount <= 0
```

#### 2. **Macro-based test**
```sql
-- macros/test_positive_values.sql
test positive_values(model, column_name)
  select *
  from model
  where column_name <= 0
endtest
```

#### 3. **Advanced business logic test**
```sql
-- tests/assert_revenue_consistency.sql
with daily_revenue as (
  select 
    date_trunc('day', created_at) as date,
    sum(amount) as total_revenue
  from ref('orders')
  where status = 'completed'
  group by 1
),
revenue_changes as (
  select 
    *,
    lag(total_revenue) over (order by date) as prev_revenue,
    abs(total_revenue - lag(total_revenue) over (order by date)) / 
    lag(total_revenue) over (order by date) as change_rate
  from daily_revenue
)
select *
from revenue_changes
where change_rate > 0.5  -- More than 50% dramatic change
```

### Test Execution and Monitoring

#### Test execution commands
```bash
# Run all tests
dbt test

# Run tests for specific model only
dbt test --models users

# Save test results to file
dbt test --store-failures
```

### 2. Data Quality Metrics Definition

#### Quality Metrics Classification

| **Metric Category** | **Measurement** | **Target** | **Threshold** |
|---------------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|
| **Completeness** | NULL value ratio | < 5% | 5% |
| **Accuracy** | Data validation failure rate | < 1% | 1% |

## 🚀 Advanced Data Quality Strategies {#advanced-data-quality-strategies}

### 1. Data Drift Detection

#### Statistical Drift Detection
```sql
-- models/data_quality/drift_detection.sql
with current_stats as (
  select 
    avg(amount) as mean_amount,
    stddev(amount) as std_amount,
    count(*) as record_count,
    current_date as measurement_date
  from ref('fact_orders')
  where created_at >= current_date - 7
),
historical_stats as (
  select 
    avg(amount) as mean_amount,
    stddev(amount) as std_amount,
    count(*) as record_count,
    current_date - 7 as measurement_date
  from ref('fact_orders')
  where created_at >= current_date - 14
    and created_at < current_date - 7
),
drift_analysis as (
  select 
    c.mean_amount as current_mean,
    h.mean_amount as historical_mean,
    abs(c.mean_amount - h.mean_amount) / h.mean_amount as mean_drift_ratio,
    c.std_amount as current_std,
    h.std_amount as historical_std,
    abs(c.std_amount - h.std_amount) / h.std_amount as std_drift_ratio,
    c.record_count as current_count,
    h.record_count as historical_count,
    abs(c.record_count - h.record_count) / h.record_count as count_drift_ratio
  from current_stats c
  cross join historical_stats h
)

select 
  *,
  case 
    when mean_drift_ratio > 0.2 or std_drift_ratio > 0.3 or count_drift_ratio > 0.5 
    then 'drift_detected'
    else 'normal'
  end as drift_status
from drift_analysis
```

### 2. Automated Quality Management

    - name: Run dbt tests
      run: |
        dbt deps
        dbt test --store-failures
```

### 3. Team Collaboration and Governance
