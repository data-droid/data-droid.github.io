## 🏗️ What is Lakehouse?

Data Lakehouse is an architecture that combines the advantages of Data Lake and Data Warehouse. It was first proposed by Databricks in 2020.

**💡 Core Concept**

Lakehouse is an integrated data platform that simultaneously provides **the flexibility of data lakes** and **the performance of data warehouses**.

## ⚠️ Limitations of Traditional Architecture

### Problems with Data Lakes

- **Absence of ACID Transactions**: Difficulty in ensuring data consistency
- **Lack of Schema Management**: Data quality and validation issues
- **Query Performance Degradation**: Slow response during large-scale data analysis
- **Absence of Data Governance**: Lack of access control and audit functions

### Limitations of Data Warehouses

- **Cost Increase**: High costs for data storage and processing
- **Scalability Limitations**: Difficulty in processing large-scale unstructured data
- **Data Movement**: Data duplication and delays during ETL processes
- **Lack of Flexibility**: Complex migration when changing schemas

## 🚀 Benefits of Lakehouse

### 🔒 ACID Transactions

Provides reliable data analysis environment by ensuring data consistency and integrity

### 📊 Schema Management

Improves data quality through schema evolution and version management

### ⚡ High-Performance Queries

Fast data search and analysis through indexing and partitioning

### 💰 Cost Efficiency

Cost optimization through separation of low-cost storage and high-performance computing

### 🔄 Real-time Processing

Integration of streaming data and batch data processing

### 🛡️ Data Governance

Provides access control, auditing, and data lineage management functions

## 🔧 Core Technologies

### 1. Table Format

The core of Lakehouse is table format. This supports ACID transactions and schema management.

**Major Table Formats:**
- **Delta Lake**: ACID transaction support developed by Databricks
- **Apache Iceberg**: Schema evolution specialization started by Netflix
- **Apache Hudi**: Real-time processing specialization developed by Uber

### 2. Metadata Management

Manages metadata at the file level to overcome limitations of centralized metastores.

**Metadata Layers:**
- **File Level**: Schema and statistical information of each data file
- **Table Level**: Schema and partition information of entire tables
- **Catalog Level**: Catalogs managing multiple tables

### 3. Query Engine

Supports various query engines to meet diverse analysis requirements.

**Supported Engines:**
- **Spark SQL**: Large-scale data processing
- **Presto/Trino**: Interactive queries
- **Flink**: Streaming data processing

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Data Engineering

- **ETL/ELT Pipelines**: Data transformation and loading
- **Data Quality Management**: Schema validation and data verification
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Streaming data integration

### 2. Data Analysis

- **Business Intelligence**: Dashboards and reports
- **Data Science**: Machine learning model development
- **Ad-hoc Analysis**: Temporary data analysis

### 3. Data Governance

- **Access Control**: Role-based access control
- **Data Lineage**: Tracking data sources and transformation history
- **Auditing**: Recording data access and usage history

## 🔮 Future Prospects

### 1. Technology Development

- **AI/ML Integration**: Support for machine learning workflows
- **Automation**: Automation of data quality and performance optimization
- **Multi-cloud**: Support for various cloud environments

### 2. Ecosystem Expansion
