## 1. Introduction to Deep Learning in Time Series

### Why Deep Learning for Time Series?

Traditional statistical methods like ARIMA and Prophet have limitations:
- **Linear assumptions**: Cannot capture complex non-linear patterns
- **Fixed patterns**: Struggle with evolving seasonality and trends
- **Limited features**: Cannot incorporate external variables effectively

Deep learning models offer several advantages:
- **Non-linear modeling**: Can capture complex temporal relationships
- **Feature learning**: Automatically discovers relevant patterns
- **Scalability**: Handle large datasets and multiple variables
- **Flexibility**: Adapt to various time series characteristics

### Key Challenges in Deep Learning Time Series

1. **Temporal dependencies**: Long-range relationships
2. **Seasonality**: Multiple seasonal patterns
3. **Non-stationarity**: Changing statistical properties
4. **Missing data**: Irregular sampling and gaps

## 2. N-BEATS: Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series

### What is N-BEATS?

N-BEATS (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series) is a deep neural architecture specifically designed for time series forecasting. It was introduced by Oreshkin et al. in 2019 and has shown remarkable performance on various forecasting tasks.

### Key Features of N-BEATS

**üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design**
- **Deep neural network**: Multiple fully connected layers
- **Residual connections**: Skip connections for better gradient flow
- **Basis expansion**: Decomposes time series into interpretable components
- **No recurrent connections**: Pure feedforward architecture

**üìä Interpretability**
- **Trend component**: Long-term patterns
- **Seasonality component**: Repeating patterns
- **Residual component**: Remaining variations

### N-BEATS Architecture

```
Input ‚Üí Block 1 ‚Üí Block 2 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Block N ‚Üí Output
         ‚Üì         ‚Üì                ‚Üì
    Trend + Seasonality + Residual
```

Each block consists of:
1. **Fully connected layers** with ReLU activation
2. **Basis expansion** for trend and seasonality
3. **Residual connections** for gradient flow

### Advantages of N-BEATS

- **Interpretable**: Clear trend and seasonality decomposition
- **Fast training**: No recurrent connections
- **Scalable**: Handles multiple time series
- **Robust**: Good performance across different domains

## 3. DeepAR: Deep Autoregressive Models

### What is DeepAR?

DeepAR is a probabilistic forecasting model that combines deep learning with autoregressive processes. It was developed by Amazon and is particularly effective for forecasting multiple related time series.

### Key Features of DeepAR

**üîÑ Autoregressive Nature**
- **Sequential prediction**: Each prediction depends on previous values
- **Probabilistic output**: Provides uncertainty estimates
- **Multiple time series**: Can handle related series simultaneously

**üß† Neural Architecture**
- **LSTM/GRU cells**: Capture temporal dependencies
- **Attention mechanism**: Focus on relevant historical patterns
- **Conditional generation**: Generate forecasts step by step

### DeepAR Architecture

### Advantages of DeepAR

- **Probabilistic**: Provides uncertainty quantification
- **Multi-series**: Handles related time series
- **Flexible**: Incorporates external variables
- **Scalable**: Efficient for large datasets

## 4. Hands-on Implementation

### Setting Up the Environment

First, let's install the required packages:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
pip install scikit-learn
```

### Implementing N-BEATS

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class NBEATSBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(NBEATSBlock, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

class NBEATS(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_blocks, forecast_horizon):
        super(NBEATS, self).__init__()
        self.num_blocks = num_blocks
        self.forecast_horizon = forecast_horizon
        
        # Create blocks
        self.blocks = nn.ModuleList([
            NBEATSBlock(input_size, hidden_size, forecast_horizon)
            for _ in range(num_blocks)
        ])
        
        # Final projection
        self.final_projection = nn.Linear(num_blocks * forecast_horizon, forecast_horizon)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        block_outputs = []
        
        for block in self.blocks:
            block_out = block(x)
            block_outputs.append(block_out)
            
        # Concatenate all block outputs
        concatenated = torch.cat(block_outputs, dim=1)
        
        # Final projection
        output = self.final_projection(concatenated)
        return output

# Example usage
input_size = 24  # Lookback window
hidden_size = 64
num_blocks = 3

        self.mu_projection = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
        self.sigma_projection = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
        
    def forward(self, x, hidden=None):
        # LSTM forward pass
        lstm_out, hidden = self.lstm(x, hidden)
        
        # Get last output
        last_output = lstm_out[:, -1, :]
        
        # Point forecast
        point_forecast = self.output_projection(last_output)
        
        # Distribution parameters
        mu = self.mu_projection(last_output)
        sigma = torch.exp(self.sigma_projection(last_output))  # Ensure positive
        
        return point_forecast, mu, sigma, hidden
    
    def init_hidden(self, batch_size, device):

### Data Preparation

```python
def prepare_time_series_data(data, lookback=24, forecast_horizon=12):
    """
    Prepare time series data for deep learning models
    
    Args:
