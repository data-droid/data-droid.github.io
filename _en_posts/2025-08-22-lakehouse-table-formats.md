# Lakehouse Table Formats: Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi

The core of data lakehouse is combining the flexibility of existing data lakes with data warehouse features like ACID transactions, schema evolution, data quality assurance, etc. What makes this possible is the **Table Format**.

Currently, the three most widely used table formats are:

- **Delta Lake** - Open source project developed by Databricks
- **Apache Iceberg** - Started by Netflix and moved to Apache Foundation
- **Apache Hudi** - Developed by Uber and moved to Apache Foundation

## 1. Introduction

**üí° What is a Table Format?**

A table format is a standardized way to manage metadata of data stored in data lakes and provide features like ACID transactions, schema evolution, partitioning, indexing, etc. This allows data lakes to be used like data warehouses.

## 2. Delta Lake

### 2.1 Overview

**Delta Lake** is a table format open-sourced by Databricks in 2019, providing ACID transactions to data lakes through tight integration with Apache Spark.

- [Blog](https://delta.io/blog/)

### 2.2 Key Features

- **ACID Transactions**: Ensures atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability
- **Schema Enforcement**: Ensures data quality and integrity
- **Schema Evolution**: Supports safe schema changes
- **Time Travel**: Access to past data versions
- **Upsert/Merge**: Efficient data updates
- **Open Format**: Compatible with all tools based on Parquet

### 2.3 Architecture

Delta Lake has the following layered structure:

**Application Layer**
- Spark SQL
- Spark Streaming
- BI Tools

**Delta Lake Layer**
- ACID transactions
- Schema management
- Metadata processing

**Storage Layer**
- Parquet files
- Transaction logs
- Checkpoints

## 3. Apache Iceberg

### 3.1 Overview

**Apache Iceberg** is a table format started by Netflix and moved to Apache Foundation, supporting efficient schema evolution and partitioning for large-scale datasets.

### 3.2 Key Features

- **Schema Evolution**: Safe and efficient schema changes
- **Partition Evolution**: Support for partition layout changes
- **Time Travel**: Access to past snapshots
- **ACID Transactions**: Atomic write guarantees
- **Metadata Layers**: Efficient metadata management

### 3.3 Architecture

Iceberg has the following metadata layers:

**Catalog Layer**: Table metadata management
**Metadata Layer**: Snapshots, manifests, schema information
**Data Layer**: Actual data files (Parquet, ORC, Avro)

## 4. Apache Hudi

### 4.1 Overview

**Apache Hudi** is a table format developed by Uber and moved to Apache Foundation, specialized in real-time data processing and incremental processing.

### 4.2 Key Features

- **Real-time Processing**: Support for streaming data processing
- **Incremental Processing**: Processing only changed data
- **ACID Transactions**: Atomic write guarantees
- **Time Travel**: Access to past data versions
- **CDC Support**: Change Data Capture support

### 4.3 Architecture

Hudi supports two table types:

**Copy-on-Write (CoW)**: Creates new files during writes
**Merge-on-Read (MoR)**: Merges data during reads

## 5. Comparison of Three Platforms

| Feature | Delta Lake | Apache Iceberg | Apache Hudi |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Developer** | Databricks | Netflix/Apache | Uber/Apache |
| **Spark Integration** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Real-time Processing** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Schema Evolution** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Partition Evolution** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Community** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |

## 6. Use Cases and Selection Guide

### When to Choose Delta Lake
- When working in **Spark-based environments**
- When **ACID transactions** are important
- When using **Databricks environments**

### When to Choose Apache Iceberg
- When dealing with **large-scale datasets**
- When **schema evolution** occurs frequently
- When **partition layout changes** are needed

### When to Choose Apache Hudi
- When **real-time data processing** is needed
- When **incremental processing** is important
- When implementing **CDC (Change Data Capture)**

## 7. Conclusion

The three table formats each have their own advantages and specialized areas. It's important to choose the appropriate format considering project requirements and technology stack.

**Delta Lake**: Stable ACID transactions in Spark-centered environments
**Apache Iceberg**: When large-scale data and complex schema evolution are needed
**Apache Hudi**: When real-time processing and incremental processing are important
